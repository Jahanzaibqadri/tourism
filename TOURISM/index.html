<h5> Here is the List of most Beautiful places for visit in Pakistan</h5>
 <ol><p><h2> <a href="Swat valley.html" <h2>Swat Vallay</h2>  </a></p>
    <ol>Though it has had a rough past, the present and future of Swat Valley are shining very bright. This stunning valley in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan is something straight out of a fairy tale.

        Think bright green fields and forests, picturesque villages, and rivers boasting shades of blue so clear and bright you wouldn’t have thought them real! </ol>

    <p><h2> <a href="hunza.html" <h2>Hunza Village</h2>  </a></p>
   <ol> If you live in Pakistan – or have read anything about the country – it’s almost certain you’ve come across the name Hunza. Don’t let the word ‘valley’ confuse you, though – Hunza is actually a massive district made up of numerous valleys and villages. One part of the ancient Silk Road, here are some of the most beautiful sights in Hunza:</ol> 
    
   <p> <h2> <a href="yarkhun valley.html" <h2>Yarkhun Valley</h2>  </a></p>
    <ol>Though it’s relatively unheard of and forgotten compared to Pakistan’s most famous tourist spots, I think Yarkhun Valley was the most beautiful place I visited in the country. Located in the Upper Chitral district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Yarkhun dazzles with its mountain ranges and untouched villages.

        Reaching the valley, which stretches for many kilometres past the administrative town of Mastuj, requires a bit of effort if you don’t have your own vehicle. If you do have one though, the ride isn’t too bad – just prepare for mostly dirt roads!</ol>
    <p><h2> <a href="phander lake.html" <h2>Phander Lake</h2>  </a></p>
    <ol> Phander Lake, located in Phander Village, is almost too good to be true. The teal-coloured lake sits silently amongst light-green trees befitting a landscape painting.</li>
