        <h2> <dfn> SWAT VALLEY </dfn></h2>
        <P> it has had a rough past, the present and future of Swat Valley are shining very bright. This stunning valley in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan is something straight out of a fairy tale.

        Think bright green fields and forests, picturesque villages, and rivers boasting shades of blue so clear and bright you wouldn’t have thought them real!</P>
        <ul> <dfn> Boyun Village </dfn>
            <p>Boyun, also known as Green Top, is a short drive or manageable up-hill walk from Kalam town. When you finally reached the pinnacle, you’ll be rewarded with a panorama of one of the most vast and beautiful villages I’ve ever seen – along with sweeping views of the valley below. Boyun is an easy day trip from Kalam.</p></ul>

            <ul> <dfn> Kandol and Spindhor Lakes    </dfn>
                <ul> These alpine lakes lie 2 hours away from Kalam. These days, Kandol Lake is accessible via jeep track and is a bit more commercialised, whereas Spindhor can only be reached on a 2-hour trek. Whichever you choose to visit, both are absolutely counted among the most beautiful places in Pakistan.

            <ul> <dfn>Ushu Forest </dfn></ul>
                    <p> This well-preserved forest is full of deodar trees and is a fabulous place to get lost. The road that leads into the forest continues on to several villages set along the Kalam River. </p>
